Motivated by Ceph usage in our OSiRIS project, University of Michigan has joined the Ceph Foundation as an Associate Member!  We join other educational, government, and research organizations engaged in the Ceph foundation at this membership level. 

From the Foundation website:  The Ceph Foundation exists to enable industry members to collaborate and pool resources to support the Ceph project community. The Foundation provides an open, collaborative, and neutral home for project stakeholders to coordinate their development and community investments in the Ceph ecosystem.

The Ceph Foundation is organized as a directed fund under the Linux Foundation.  Thanks to U-M's recent push to join the Cloud Native Computing Foundation the institution is already a member of the Linux Foundation and was enthusiastic to expand participation in open communities with the Ceph Foundation.

OSiRIS is an NSF funded collaboration between University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Wayne State University, and Indiana University.  All of these institutions make valuable contributions to the project and without them our participation in the foundation would not be possible.
