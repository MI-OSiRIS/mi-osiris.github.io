Shawn McKee, OSiRIS project PI and founding director of the Center for Network and Storage-Enabled Collaborative Computational Science at U Michigan (<a href="http://micde.umich.edu/centers/cnseccs/">CNSECCS</a>), talks with HGST SanDisk about the challenges of scientific collaboration on big data.  

"The vision that we have with OSiRIS...is to see an infrastructure in place that would work for all researchers, so that the institution wouldn’t have to provide a customized solution for each science domain. Instead, they could have something they can scale and adjust to everyone’s needs."
