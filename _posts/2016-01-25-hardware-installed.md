We've begun vetting the hardware and will be working on provisioning and configuration soon!  

Pictured are um-virt01 (virtualized services), um-globus01 (globus gateway), um-ps01 (perfSonar), and the Ceph storage block um-stor01 with attached Dell MD3060e storage.  The three 1U nodes are Dell R630 and the 2U storage block headnode is a Dell R730xd.
