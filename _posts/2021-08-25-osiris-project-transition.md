After a successful 6 year prototyping and operations period, the <a href="https://www.osris.org">OSiRIS project</a> is transitioning to a best-effort mode for at least the next year.  We have provided multiple petabytes of distributed, performant storage for scientists across our three main Universities and beyond. As we make this transition we want to thank all the collaborators and science users who participated in the OSiRIS project. The project team continues to explore possible follow-on projects that could build upon what we have created with OSiRIS.  If new opportunities arise we will share details on the osiris-announce@umich.edu mailing list.

<!--excerpt-->

We are in the process of finalizing our whitepaper which discusses the technical details of how OSiRIS is constructed and documents our choices for technology and configuration so others who are interested could create their own OSiRIS deployment.    Please watch the web site for updates on the <a href="https://www.osris.org/documentation/">whitepaper</a>

As we write our final project report, we are very interested in gathering feedback about OSiRIS and its impacts on science.   Please send along comments, critiques and suggestions to our mailing list osiris-help@umich.edu with the Subject: starting with “FEEDBACK:”  We would love to hear from you.  As noted, our goal is to try to continue to make OSiRIS resources available for our users for at least another year.  Responses to emails may be slower than usual, given the best effort nature of the support.   Our users may want to explore other options for hosting their data, given that the project funding is ending.   Please contact us using the osiris-help mailing list above if you have questions or concerns.

Lastly, and most importantly, we want to thank the National Science Foundation and our institutions (Indiana University, Michigan State University, University of Michigan and Wayne State University) for their strong support in creating and sustaining OSiRIS.
