OSiRIS is funded by the NSF via a CC*DNI DIBBs grant awarded to the University of Michigan, Michigan State, Wayne State and Indiana University. <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1541335&HistoricalAwards=false">Award Details</a> are publicly available on the NSF website.  The project also incorporates a small storage cache tier and services for researchers at the Van Andel Institute.

<p>
OSiRIS will provide a distributed, multi-institutional storage infrastructure that lets researchers write, manage, and share data from their own computing facility locations. It's goal is transparent, high-performance access to the same storage infrastructure from well-connected locations on any participating campus. 
</p>
<p>
    OSiRIS includes network discovery, monitoring and management tools as well as the creative use of Ceph features. The project will provide data sharing, archiving, security and life-cycle managment, implemented and maintained with a single distributed service.
