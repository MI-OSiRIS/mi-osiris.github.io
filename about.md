OSiRIS (Open Storage Research Infrastructure) is a NSF CC*DNI DIBBs grant awarded to the University of Michigan, Michigan State, Wayne State and Indiana University. [Award Details](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1541335&HistoricalAwards=false) are publicly available on the NSF website.  

OSiRIS will provide a distributed, multi-institutional storage infrastructure that lets researchers write, manage, and share data from their own computing facility locations. It's goal is transparent, high-performance access to the same storage infrastructure from well-connected locations on any participating campus. It includes network discovery, monitoring and management tools as well as the creative use of Ceph features. The project will provide data sharing, archiving, security and life-cycle managment, implemented and maintained with a single distributed service.

The [Michigan News](http://ns.umich.edu/new/releases/23151-big-data-5m-to-widen-bottleneck-to-discovery) service produced a great article about the project shortly after the grant was awarded.

OSiRIS project engineering is coordinated by University Of Michigan Advanced Research Computing - Technology Services ([ARC-TS](http://arc-ts.umich.edu/systems-and-services/osiris/)).    

The Principal Investigator is Shawn McKee, Research Scientist in the Department of Physics and the Director of the Center for Network and Storage-Enabled Collaborative Computational Science ([CNSECCS](http://micde.umich.edu/centers/cnseccs/)). CNSECCS and OSiRIS are operated under the auspices of the Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery and Engineering ([MICDE](http://micde.umich.edu/osiris)).
