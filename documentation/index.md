We've included here instructions for OSiRIS users as well as for other sites that are interested in setting up an installation similar to OSiRIS.

<h3>User Documentation</h3>

<p>
<a href="enrollment.html">Enrolling in OSiRIS:</a> 

How to enroll in your OSiRIS COU and obtain access tokens for use with OSiRIS Storage
</p>

<p>
<a href="s3fuse.html">Configuring an S3 fuse mount:</a>

OSiRIS can provide Ceph storage accessible with the S3 protocol.  The S3 fuse program will present S3 buckets as mounted filesystems though the standard http-based S3 protocol is used for all operations and typical S3 clients can also be used to access the same data.
