<p>
Building on existing collaboration between MSU and the Grand Rapids based Van Andel Institute, OSiRIS has installed NVMe-based Ceph OSD nodes and an NFS gateway at the institute to enable direct access to bioinformatics research data.  OSIRIS at VAI will enable VAI bioinformaticians to work with MSU researchers to better understand Parkinson's disease and cance.  OSiRIS facilitates data access for VAI researchers to leverage the computational resources at MSU Institute for Cyber Enabled Research.

<p>        
U.S. Naval Research Lab is collaborating with researchers at UM to share their high-resolution ocean models with a global community. This unclassified data was stored on US Navy computers that were not easily accessible to many researchers.  OSiRIS  enables scientists worldwide to leverage these models.

<a href="atlas.html"><img style="width: 10%" class="lf" src="{{IMAGE_PATH}}/logos/atlas_logo.png" alt="ATLAS Project Logo"/></a>
<p>The ATLAS Event Service is designed to leverage object stores like OSiRIS  for fine grained physics event data which can  be retrieved and computed in small chunks and leverage transient compute resources.

<p>        
The JETSCAPE collaboration at WSU is an NSF funded multi-institutional effort to design event simulators for ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions.  OSiRIS provides a universal storage platform for collaborative access.

<img class="lf" style="width: 25%" src="{{IMAGE_PATH}}/logos/nightlights_map_logo.png" alt="Global Nightlights Map"/>
<p>
Global Nightlights at UM is the only complete archive of NOAA nighttime imagery from 2 different satellite programs: DMSP (1993-2016) and VIIRS (2012-ongoing).  By keeping portions of this archive on OSiRIS we enable wider usage of the datasets by researchers outside the institution.
