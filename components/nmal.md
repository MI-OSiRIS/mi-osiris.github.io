The Network Management Abstraction Layer (NMAL) will extend [perfSONAR](http://www.perfsonar.net)
capabilities to include automated network topology discovery and tracking in the
Unified Network Information Service (UNIS), and incorporate that into overall operations of the OSiRIS infrastructure.

We plan to deploy and maintain perfSONAR components (both within OSiRIS and at our “client”
locations) to allow monitoring and measuring the networks interconnecting science
domain users and OSiRIS components, and providing input to the Network Fault
Localization Service (NFLS) and the Network Orchestration Service (NOS).
