**Main Attributes of OSiRIS**

* Enables storage-integrated data lifecycle management possibilities.
* Provides a software-defined storage service for multi-institutional domains
* Built from inexpensive, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components
* Robust, reliable infrastructure constructed to minimize single points of failure
* High performance by integrating high-bandwidth network links, a large number of disk spindles, large server memory and SSDs
* Built using open source software components allowing the project to customize specific components to provide required OSiRIS functionality
* Incorporates detailed monitoring of the infrastructure/network topology.
* Enables cloud infrastructures, e.g., OpenStack
* Collaborative storage for researchers/resources outside of our campuses
* Connected to the Internet at 10 to 100 Gbps
* Uses Globus Connect(Alliance, 2014) GridFTP-based Data Transfer Nodes (each at 4x10Gbps) for wide-area data transfer
