[Ceph](http://www.ceph.com) is a distributed object store and file system designed to provide excellent performance, reliability and scalability.  

OSiRIS plans to leverage Ceph in a distributed storage infrastructure spanning all member institutions that supports
effective access to data in-place and that will provide sufficient quality of service for its science domain users, 
independent of which institution they are accessing the system from.
